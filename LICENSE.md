# Licenses

`<html-import>` available under two different licenses depending on how you plan to use it:

* For **open-source** projects the [GPLv3 license](https://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) applies. You can download `<html-import>` and do with it what you want, as long as derivative work is licensed under an equivalent license.
* If you want to use `<html-import>` for **commercial/closed source** projects [just talk to me](https://www.peterkroener.de/kontakt/) and we can figure something out. I'll probably grant you a free license with no strings attached if you ask nicely.
